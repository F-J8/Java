/*
* 1. variables can store two types of things: primitives and references
* object state - instance variables
* local variables - variables declared within a method
* variables as arguments - values sent to a method by the calling code
* return types values sent backj to the caller of the method.
* primitive integer types (type int)
*
*
* java cares about type
 type safety
 variables: primitive and object reference
 primitives hold fundamental values (simple bit patterns): integers, booleans, and floating point numbers.
 object references hold references to objects
 variables must have a type and name
 int count
* A variable is just a vup a container it holds something
*
* it has a size and type. primitives
* long 64 bit (huge to huge)
* int  32 bit ( - 2147483648 to  147483647)
* short 16 bit (- 32768 to 32767)
* byte 8 bit (-128 to 127)
* float 32 bit (varies)
* double 64 bit(varies)
* boolean char byte short int long float double
*
* there is actually no such thing as an object variable
* there is only an object reference variable
* an object reference variable
* an object reference variable holds bits that represent way to access an object.
* it doesn't hold the onject itself, but it holds something like a pointer. onr an adress. Except in java we don't really know what is inside
* a reference variable, We do know that whatever it is, it represents one and only one object. And the JVM knows how to use the reference to get the object.
* final assigns one object and that is the only object it can reference
*
*
* an arrai is like a tray of cups
* maps, trees, and sets
