/*
* what's the difference between a class and an object?
*
* 1. A class is not an object but it is used to construct them
* 2. A class is a blueprint for an object. it tells the VM how to make an object of that particular type.
* 3. An object is like one entry in your contacts list.
* 4. to create an object you need two classes. one class is the object i want to use, and the other is the one is a test class.
* 5. objects are instances of the class.
* 5. as long as you are in main you are not in objectville
* 5 Two uses of main: To test your real class, To launch/start your Java application
* 6.
