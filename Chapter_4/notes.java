/*
* State affect behavior , behavior affects state.
*
* Objects Have STATE        and     BEHAVIOR represented by
*       instance variables          mathods.
*
* methods use instance variable values,
* Reminder: a class decribes what an object knows and what an object does
* A class is the blueprint how the JVM should make an objet of that type.
*
* A caller PASSES ARGUMENTS . A method Takes parameters. (page 74 it makes all sense)
*
* argument - a value like 2, Foo, or a reference to a DOG
* parameter is a local variable.
*
* If a method takes a parameter , you must pass it something when you call it.
*
* Java is pass-by-value That means pass-by-copy.
